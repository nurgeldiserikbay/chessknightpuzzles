Players control a knight piece, whose sole mission is to collect all the coins scattered throughout the game field. However, there's one catch: the knight can only move in its signature L-shaped pattern, just like in chess. \n The game board is populated with a mixture of coins and stones. Coins represent valuable treasures that players must collect, while stones act as barriers impeding the knight's progress. Players must carefully plan their routes to efficiently gather all the coins. \n Each level presents a unique arrangement of coins and stones, with the difficulty gradually increasing. As players progress, they'll encounter more challenging puzzles that require strategic thinking and foresight. They must analyze the board layout, anticipate potential obstacles, and strategically maneuver the knight to maximize their coin collection. \n Chess Knight Puzzles offers an engaging blend of puzzle-solving and strategic gameplay, providing players with moments of captivating challenges. With its intuitive controls and progressively challenging levels, it's the perfect game for puzzle enthusiasts and chess lovers alike. Can you guide the knight through the obstacles and collect all the coins?","orientation":"portrait","theme_color":"#fff","protocol_handlers":[],"icons":[{"src":"./icons/favicon-16x16.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"16x16"},{"src":"./icons/favicon-32x32.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"32x32"},{"src":"./icons/mstile-70x70.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"128x128"},{"src":"./icons/mstile-144x144.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"144x144"},{"src":"./icons/mstile-150x150.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"270x270"},{"src":"./icons/mstile-310x150.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"558x270"},{"src":"./icons/mstile-310x310.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"558x558"},{"src":"./icons/android-chrome-192x192.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"192x192"},{"src":"./icons/android-chrome-512x512.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"512x512"},{"src":"./icons/apple-touch-icon.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"180x180"}],"display_override":["window-controls-overlay"],"screenshots":[{"src":"./screenshots/narrow-1.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"540x720","form_factor":"narrow"},{"src":"./screenshots/narrow-2.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"540x720","form_factor":"narrow"},{"src":"./screenshots/narrow-3.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"540x720","form_factor":"narrow"},{"src":"./screenshots/narrow-4.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"540x720","form_factor":"narrow"},{"src":"./screenshots/narrow-5.png","type":"image/png","sizes":"540x720","form_factor":"narrow"},{"src":"./screenshots/wide-1.png","type":"image/jpeg","sizes":"1024x502","form_factor":"wide"},{"src":"./screenshots/wide-2.png","type":"image/jpeg","sizes":"1024x502","form_factor":"wide"},{"src":"./screenshots/wide-3.png","type":"image/jpeg","sizes":"1024x502","form_factor":"wide"},{"src":"./screenshots/wide-4.png","type":"image/jpeg","sizes":"1024x502","form_factor":"wide"},{"src":"./screenshots/wide-5.png","type":"image/jpeg","sizes":"1024x502","form_factor":"wide"}]}
